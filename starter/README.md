# Welcome to ui.js!

You've just downloaded the ui.js starter kit... Congratulations!

To begin, check out the `examples/` directory for a bunch of examples, or check out [Getting Started](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html) for more information.

In some browsers our examples won't work from the local file system; run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` and visit `http://localhost:8000/` to view them.

Want to start your own app? Just copy `examples/basic-jsx-external` and start hacking! Remember: before launching you'll want to precompile your JSX code as we do in `examples/basic-jsx-precompiled`; this requires doing `npm install -g ui.js-tools` and then running our `jsx` tool. See [Getting Started](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html) for more information.

Happy Hacking!
